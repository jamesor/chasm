# Chasm - A Text Adventure

Chasm is a simple text adventure game inspired by the classics such as Zork, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Ballyhoo.

## Goal of the Game

The goal of the game is to reach a total of **5 points**. Currently, a "you've won" state has not been implemented and you will be able to continue to move after reaching your goal. This will change with a higher goal and a more rewarding payoff screen.

## Banner

The banner across the top of the screen will show you:
+ Your current location
+ Your current score
+ Your total number of moves taken so far

## Image

The image is a depiction of the location you are currently at.

## Input

+ `n`, `north`, `e`, `east`, `s`, `south`, `w`, `west`, `u`, `up`, `d` and `down` are commands you can use to travel from one location to another.
+ `i` or `inventory` will list the items you are currently carrying.
+ `l` or `look` will redisplay the description of the location you are currently in.
